## Status

### Render migration prepared — 2026-09-30

- `render.yaml` defines a Frankfurt free Docker web service with `/health` monitoring and explicit
  production configuration. Secret values remain dashboard-managed with `sync: false`.
- `Documentation/RENDER.md` contains the safe Fly-to-Render cutover and rollback procedure.
- Fly remains production until Render is created and health, CORS, registration, auth, and
  announcement checks pass. Web order tracking should use polling initially because free-service
  sleep cannot guarantee persistent Socket.io sessions.

### Active-unit reservation — deployed 2026-09-30

- Commit `a4ff04f` is on `main` and `origin/main`.
- `POST /v1/residents/leads` returns HTTP 409 when `(building, floor, flatNumber)` already has a
  non-`REJECTED` lead, regardless of submitted email or phone.
- Partial unique index `resident_leads_active_unit_key` closes the concurrent-request race while
  allowing a rejected unit lead to be submitted again. Prisma `P2002` maps to the same conflict.
- Production Supabase reports all 3 migrations applied. Fly release v4 is healthy in `cdg`; the
  health endpoint returns HTTP 200 with Prisma `up`.
- Validation: focused resident suite 38/38; complete backend suite 100/100; Prisma validation,
  strict typecheck, and lint pass (6 existing warnings, 0 errors).

### Web parity consumer — 2026-09-30

The deployed `eastpark-web-app` is expanding toward mobile feature parity. It uses same-origin Next.js
BFF routes and `HttpOnly` cookies; browsers should not receive backend access/refresh tokens or call
protected Fly endpoints directly. Existing backend routes and DTO behavior are authoritative. Do not
invent or duplicate endpoints for web when an existing mobile contract already serves the flow.

The parent pnpm workspace and `packages/shared` experiment are deferred. This backend remains
independently installable and does not consume it. Never move NestJS, Prisma, transport, auth, or
framework code into a shared package.

✅ **2026-09-30 — DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION.**

- API: `https://eastpark-backend.fly.dev`
- Health: HTTP 200 with Prisma `up`
- Public lead endpoint: HTTP 200 and Supabase insert verified
- Vercel-origin CORS preflight: HTTP 204
- Remote Docker image built and pushed successfully.
- `prisma migrate deploy` connected through the Supabase session pooler and reported no pending
  migrations.
- Production startup fixes: `.swcrc` included in Docker context, production install skips Husky
  lifecycle scripts and explicitly generates Prisma, and all DTO Faker runtime imports were removed.

**Required cleanup:** rotate credentials exposed during deployment. `PAYMOB_HMAC_SECRET` is a
temporary startup-only value; configure real Paymob credentials before enabling card payments.
This does not block `POST /v1/residents/leads`.

✅ **2026-09-29 pass: 8 commits (`ef82e2c`…`43af496`), tree clean, nothing pushed.**
`pnpm typecheck` exit 0 · `pnpm lint:check` exit 0 · **tests 101/101** (was 62/62).

- Docker build **repaired** — it could not have succeeded before: the `prisma` CLI was a
  devDependency (so the production image had no binary for `migrate deploy`), and `postinstall`
  ran `prisma generate` before `prisma/` was copied. Also `exec` for SIGTERM, non-root user.
- `ResidentLead` + `ResidentsModule` — public `POST /v1/residents/leads`, 5 req/min/IP, with
  database-backed active-unit reservation. Backs the `eastpark-web-app` form. 38 focused tests.
- `User.phone @unique` **removed** (one phone belongs to an apartment, not a person),
  26 indexes added (schema had zero), and **a migration** covering all of it.
- `APP_ENV=production` in fly.toml — closes Swagger/CSP/CORS exposure. Health check on `/health`
  (**not** `/v1/health` — the controller is `VERSION_NEUTRAL`).

**Open — see `COMPLETION-ROADMAP.md` for the full ranked list:** the Paymob webhook does not verify
the paid amount (`payments.service.ts:135-149`) · money is still `Float` (schema.prisma:216/237/263;
Decimal is a BREAKING API change without `.toNumber()` boundary mapping) · real whole-repo coverage
is **12.44%**, not the headline 81.11% (that figure averages only the 5 files in `test/jest.json`).

**2026-09-30 — Postgres moved from Neon to Supabase.** One vendor for DB + Storage, and Neon's free
tier could not host this app: the Fly health check queries the DB every 15s, so the compute never
scale-to-zeros, and always-on burns ~183 of the 100 free CU-hours/month — suspended around day 16,
every month. Supabase free is capacity-limited (500MB), not clock-limited. `directUrl` added
(`DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`, session pooler 5432); `SMTP_HOST`/`SUPABASE_URL` now in fly.toml.
**Connection-string traps are in `README.md` step 5 — read before setting secrets.**

Earlier: all 2026-07-19 audit blockers fixed 2026-07-26 — see `backend_review.md`.

✅ All 8 phases + all 6 gaps + wiring fixes + 2 full audit passes complete. Running locally since 2026-04-02. Branch: main.

### Audit 2026-07-19 → all fixed 2026-07-26 (verified with Node v24 via nvm)

- **BE-1 ✅ FIXED:** added `descriptionAr String?` to `Election` model (schema.prisma) — was a runtime Prisma crash + tsc error. Commit `42d6eaa`.
- **BE-2 ✅ FIXED:** replaced the lone incremental migration with a single full baseline migration `00000000000000_init` (`prisma migrate diff --from-empty`) + set `migration_lock.toml` provider. `prisma migrate deploy` now builds a complete fresh DB. Commit `42d6eaa`.
- **BE-3 ✅ FIXED:** `UserResponseDto` passwordHash/pushToken made optional (3 auth.service sites); invitation DTO uses `typeof Role.MERCHANT | typeof Role.ADMIN`. `pnpm typecheck` exits 0. Commit `5853834`.
- **BE-4/5/6 ✅ FIXED:** added `CacheService` mock to `payments.service.spec.ts` — 62/62 tests pass, coverage 81.11%/77.5% (payments 29.87% → 64.5%). Commit `6b2c9c8`.
- **BE-7 ✅ FIXED:** `test.yml` rewritten for pnpm + Prisma generate + typecheck/lint/test. Commit `4b0764f`.
- **B-7 (from FE audit) ✅ FIXED:** new merchant self-service module (`src/modules/merchant/`) exposes `/merchant/shop|products|orders*`, resolving the caller's shop from the JWT — the mobile app's Merchant Tools now works (was all 404s). Commit `988e7c6`.
- **✅ Corrected:** `DELETE /user` self-delete **is implemented** (`src/modules/user/controllers/user.public.controller.ts:62-69`) — old "pending" note was wrong.

### Remaining after web launch

- Rotate Fly, Supabase/database, and Brevo credentials exposed during initial deployment.
- Configure real `PAYMOB_INTEGRATION_ID`, `PAYMOB_IFRAME_ID`, and `PAYMOB_HMAC_SECRET` before card payments.
- The Paymob webhook amount-verification and money `Float` roadmap items remain open.

## Local Dev State (as of 2026-04-08)

- **Docker services:** postgres + redis + mailpit + minio — all running (`pnpm docker:up`)
- **Database:** now has a full baseline migration `00000000000000_init` (2026-07-26). Fresh DBs build via `prisma migrate deploy`. (Historically the base schema was `db push`'d with only one incomplete incremental migration — fixed in BE-2.)
- **Admin seeded:** `admin@eastpark.app` (password set via `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var)
- **`@fastify/static` installed** — required by SwaggerModule with Fastify adapter
- **Swagger fix applied** — `@ApiParam` added to `PUT /notifications/preferences/:type` to fix circular dep on `NotificationType` enum

> **Before every dev session:** Run `pnpm docker:up` first, then `pnpm dev`. Server crashes immediately without Docker.

## Admin Credentials

| Field    | Value                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Email    | `admin@eastpark.app`                  |
| Password | Set via `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var |

Defined in `prisma/seed-data.ts` (overridable via `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars). Re-run `pnpm seed` is idempotent — skips if merchants already exist.

---

## User Roles

| Role     | Registration Flow                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Guest    | No auth. Read-only API access to public endpoints.                       |
| Resident | POST /auth/register → POST /auth/verify-otp → verified                   |
| Merchant | Admin sends email invite → one-time token → POST /auth/accept-invitation |
| Admin    | Admin sends email invite → one-time token → POST /auth/accept-invitation |

---

## Seed Data

Single seed file: `prisma/seed-data.ts`. `sample.json` and `seed.ts` have been deleted.

```bash
pnpm prisma:reset   # wipe DB (destructive)
pnpm seed           # seeds everything; skips if merchants already exist (idempotent)
```

**What gets seeded:**

| Entity        | Count | Detail                                                  |
| ------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Users         | 14    | 1 admin · 5 merchants · 8 residents                     |
| Shops         | 5     | café · grocery · butcher · services · health            |
| Products      | 42    | 8–10 per shop                                           |
| Orders        | 14    | all statuses: PLACED → DELIVERED, one CANCELLED         |
| Reviews       | 16    | every shop has 2–4 reviews                              |
| Announcements | 8     | mix of GENERAL / EVENT / MAINTENANCE / NEWS / PROMOTION |
| Reports       | 5     | quarterly financial + maintenance + security            |
| Polls         | 3     | 18 votes across 8 residents                             |
| Election      | 1     | 3 candidates, 6 votes                                   |
| Feedback      | 8     | 5 admin replies                                         |
| Notifications | 15    | across all types                                        |

**Test credentials:**

All seed passwords are set via environment variables: `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `SEED_MERCHANT_PASSWORD`, `SEED_RESIDENT_PASSWORD`. See `.env.example`.

| Role      | Email                      |

## Key Patterns

**ConfigService everywhere.** Never `process.env.KEY` in services — always `this.configService.get<string>('KEY')`.

**Auth decorators:**

- `@AllowedRoles([Role.RESIDENT])` — restrict endpoint by role
- `@AuthUser() actor: IAuthUser` — extracts `{ userId, role }` from JWT payload

**Cursor pagination (all list endpoints):**

```typescript
take: limit + 1,
...(cursor ? { skip: 1, cursor: { id: cursor } } : {}),
orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
// After query: if items.length > limit → items.pop(); nextCursor = last.id
```

**Response format.** DocResponse interceptor wraps all responses: `{ success: true, message: 'i18n.key', data: ... }`.

**OTP / reset tokens.** Stored in Redis with TTL. OTP: 10min (`OTP_TTL = 600`). Reset token: 30min.

**Paymob flow:**

1. `POST /v1/orders/:id/pay/paymob` [RESIDENT] → auth token → register order → payment key (all via Paymob API)
2. Returns `{ paymentKey, iframeUrl }` — FE opens iframe
3. Webhook: `POST /webhooks/paymob` — HMAC-SHA512 verified, idempotent via Redis, flips `order.isPaid = true`

**Socket.io.** Namespace `/orders`. Emit `order:status` on status change.

**Product soft-delete.** `isDeleted: Boolean @default(false)`. Always `where: { isDeleted: false }` on queries.

**Shop photos.** `ShopPhoto.order: Int` — always `orderBy: { order: 'asc' }`. Service derives `isPrimary: index === 0` from sorted array. FE uses `photo.isPrimary` to find the cover.

**Auth responses.** `passwordHash` and `pushToken` are always stripped from user objects in `verifyOtp`, `login`, and `acceptInvitation` before returning `{ ...tokens, user }`.

**Photo ownership.** `addPhoto` / `removePhoto` enforce `shop.merchantId === actor.userId` for MERCHANT role. ADMINs bypass this check.

**Feedback access.** `GET /feedback/:id` — only ADMIN can read any feedback; all other roles are restricted to their own submissions.

**Anonymous feedback.** Strip `userId`/`author` from response when `isAnonymous: true`.

## Env Vars (see `.env.example` for full list)

```
AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=""    # generate: openssl rand -base64 48
AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=""   # must differ from above
DATABASE_URL=""
REDIS_URL=""
PAYMOB_API_KEY=""              # prod only
PAYMOB_HMAC_SECRET=""          # prod only

## Commit Convention

Format: `[AhmedMuhammedElsaid][feat|fix|chore|docs]: description`
Always use `--no-verify` (WSL cannot run node/pnpm hooks). Branch: main.

---

## Prisma

Schema: `prisma/schema.prisma`. After schema changes:

```bash
pnpm prisma:migrate      # create + apply migration (dev)
pnpm prisma:generate     # regenerate client after schema change
pnpm seed                # seeds admin@eastpark.app (idempotent)
```

---

## Local Dev

```bash
pnpm docker:up    # ALWAYS first — postgres + redis + mailpit + minio
pnpm dev          # NestJS hot-reload on http://localhost:3000/v1
```

## Deploy

```bash
fly secrets set PAYMOB_INTEGRATION_ID=<val> PAYMOB_IFRAME_ID=<val>
fly deploy
```

Region: `cdg` (Paris). Dockerfile CMD: `npx prisma migrate deploy && node dist/main`.
